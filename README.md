# How we will build our code 
- We will use grid to line up 4 animal carousels, most likely by putting them into divs and then putting those into a section 
- We will style it using css, since the images will be links we will have buttons for them showing hover and and staying a solid different color when clicked for user referance 
- If we create a cart we will probably have to use event listeners and local storage but that is sort of an extra goal 
# User stories 
- I want to be able to click on images and have them take me to the page I want so that I can decide whether or not I want the animal 
- I want the images to carousel so that I can clearly see all of the options available
